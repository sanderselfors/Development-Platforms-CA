## Description

This project implements a RESTful API server using Express.js and Pocketbase. It provides endpoints to manage products and cars data.

## Datastore

The application uses SQLite3 as the database management system. The database contains two tables: `products` and `cars`.

### Products Table

The `products` table stores information about products. Each product has the following attributes:

- `id`: Unique identifier for the product (automatically generated).
- `name`: Name of the product.
- `price`: Price of the product.

### Cars Table

The `cars` table stores information about cars. Each car has the following attributes:

- `id`: Unique identifier for the car (automatically generated).
- `brand`: Brand of the car.

## Endpoints

- [Production deploy](https://dp-ca.onrender.com/)
  
### Products Endpoints

- `GET /products`: Retrieve a list of all products.
- `GET /products/:id`: Retrieve details of a specific product.
- `POST /products`: Add a new product.
- `DELETE /products/:id`: Delete a specific product.

### Cars Endpoints

- `GET /cars`: Retrieve a list of all cars.
- `GET /cars/:id`: Retrieve details of a specific car.
- `POST /cars`: Add a new car.
- `DELETE /cars/:id`: Delete a specific car.

# Development Platforms Course Assignment Report

## Introduction

The development platforms course assignment aimed to create a robust RESTful API server using Express.js and Pocketbase for database management. Additionally, the assignment focused on implementing end-to-end testing with Cypress to ensure the reliability and functionality of the API endpoints. This report provides an overview of the project's objectives, implementation details, testing approach, and conclusions.

## Project Overview

The project involved developing a backend server to manage data related to products and cars using Express.js, a popular web application framework for Node.js. Instead of traditional database management systems, Pocketbase was utilized for its simplicity and ease of integration with Node.js applications. Pocketbase provided a NoSQL document-oriented approach to storing and querying data, offering flexibility and scalability for small to medium-scale applications.

## Implementation Details

1. **Express.js Server**: The core of the project was the Express.js server, which handled HTTP requests and responses for various endpoints. Middleware such as Morgan for logging, Helmet for security headers, and CORS for cross-origin resource sharing were integrated into the server configuration. Endpoints were defined to perform CRUD operations on products and cars data, leveraging the capabilities of Pocketbase for data storage and retrieval.

2. **Pocketbase Database**: Pocketbase served as the database management system, offering a cloud-based solution for storing JSON documents. Collections were created to represent products and cars, with each document containing attributes such as name, price, brand, and unique identifiers automatically generated by Pocketbase. The document-oriented nature of Pocketbase facilitated flexible data modeling and simplified the storage of complex data structures.

3. **API Endpoints**: The server exposed RESTful API endpoints to interact with the data stored in Pocketbase. Endpoints were implemented for listing, adding, retrieving, and deleting products and cars. Utilizing Pocketbase's query capabilities, endpoints were designed to perform efficient data operations while ensuring data integrity and security.

4. **Cypress Testing**: End-to-end testing was conducted using Cypress to validate the functionality and reliability of the API endpoints. Test scenarios were written to simulate HTTP requests to the server and assert the expected responses. Tests covered various scenarios, including listing products, adding new products, retrieving product details, and deleting products, ensuring comprehensive test coverage of the API functionality.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, the development platforms course assignment provided valuable hands-on experience in building a RESTful API server using Express.js and integrating Pocketbase for database management. Through the project, I gained practical skills in web development, including creating server-side applications, working with NoSQL databases, and writing automated tests. The use of Pocketbase offered a modern and scalable solution for data storage, while Cypress provided a robust framework for end-to-end testing, ensuring the quality and reliability of the API endpoints.

Overall, the assignment was an effective learning experience, combining theoretical knowledge with practical implementation in a real-world scenario. The skills acquired through this project will be invaluable for future endeavors in web development and software engineering, providing a solid foundation for building scalable and reliable applications in various domains.
